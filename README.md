data structures and algorithms for my CS300-SNHU


In my projects for this course, I primarily focused on developing an Advising Assistance Program. The problem I tackled was to efficiently manage and query course information, including prerequisites, using different data structures. This was crucial for creating a system that could quickly load data, display course details, and handle user inputs through a menu-driven interface.

To approach the problem, I explored three data structures: vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Each of these structures had distinct advantages and limitations in terms of performance and complexity. Understanding these data structures was essential as they significantly impact the efficiency and scalability of software applications. For instance, vectors provide simple indexing but are inefficient for insertions and deletions, hash tables offer average O(1) operations but can be memory-intensive, and binary search trees maintain sorted order but can degrade in performance if unbalanced.

During the development process, I encountered several roadblocks, particularly in handling edge cases and optimizing performance. For example, ensuring the data parsing function correctly identified and reported formatting errors required meticulous attention. Overcoming these challenges involved iterative testing, debugging, and refining the code to handle various scenarios gracefully. Utilizing structured data handling techniques and leveraging the strengths of each data structure helped mitigate these issues.

Working on this project has broadened my approach to designing software and developing programs. It highlighted the importance of choosing appropriate data structures based on the specific requirements and constraints of a problem. This experience has also refined my skills in writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. I learned to implement clear function definitions, consistent naming conventions, and comprehensive documentation, which are vital for long-term code maintenance and collaboration.

Overall, this project not only enhanced my technical abilities but also deepened my understanding of how thoughtful design and proper data management can significantly improve the functionality and user experience of software applications.
